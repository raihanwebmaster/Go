## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Go (Golang) installed on your system. You can download it from [here](https://golang.org/dl/).

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/raihanwebmaster/Go.git
   cd Go
   ```

2. Run the Go program:

   ```bash
   go run main.go
   ```

## Usage

The program demonstrates various aspects of Go programming, including working with strings, integers, slices, formatted printing, and more. Simply running the program will execute all the code snippets contained in the \`main.go\` file, and you will see the output in your terminal.

## Code Overview

### main.go

The `main.go` file contains code that demonstrates the following:

- String manipulation
- Integer and float operations
- Formatted printing
- Arrays and slices
- String functions from the standard library
- Sorting using the \`sort\` package
- Looping constructs
- Boolean expressions and conditionals

Here are some key sections of the code:

- **Strings**: Basic operations with strings.
- **Integers and Floats**: Examples of working with integer and float types.
- **Formatted Printing**: Using \`fmt.Printf\` for formatted output.
- **Arrays and Slices**: Examples of arrays and slices, including slice operations.
- **String Functions**: Using functions from the \`strings\` package.
- **Sorting**: Using the \`sort\` package to sort slices.
- **Loops**: Different ways to loop in Go.
- **Conditionals**: Using if-else statements and boolean expressions.
